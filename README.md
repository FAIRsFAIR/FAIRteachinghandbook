![](Images/2\_2\_figure\_1.png)

### Abstract

This handbook aims to support higher education institutions with the integration of FAIR-related content in their curricula and teaching. It was written and edited by a group of about 40 collaborators in a series of six book sprint events that took place between 1 and 10 June 2021. The document provides practical material, such as competence profiles, learning outcomes and lesson plans, and supporting information. It incorporates community feedback received during the public consultation which ran from 27 July to 12 September 2021.

### Maintenance

This GitBook is maintained by the University of Minho. Minor amendments (e.g. of typos, broken links, please let us know if you spot any) will be amended. However, in terms of content, it should be regarded as a “frozen publication” for the time being, i.e. we will not update the content. We approached community initiatives regarding their potential involvement in future revisions, but these discussions are still ongoing.
