## 3.3. Learning outcomes

Finally, learning outcomes were formulated (using Bloom&#39;s taxonomy). Via et al. (2020, p. 2) define learning outcomes as &quot;the KSAs [i.e. knowledge, skills and abilities] that learners should be able to demonstrate after instruction, the tangible evidence that the teaching goals have been achieved&quot;. They play an important role in the course design process (more information about this is provided in [chapter 4](../4TeachingAndTrainingDesigns/1Introduction.md)).

The learning outcomes for the Knowledge Units deemed entry level content are presented in the tables below. For the full list of learning outcomes, please see [here](../7ResourcesReferences/4KnowledgeUnits_LearningOutcomes.md).
