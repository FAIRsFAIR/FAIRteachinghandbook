### Step 1. Select or identify learning outcomes (LOs)

Learning outcomes are the starting point and driver of decision-making when developing training and teaching (see also Via et al. 2020). They are a reflection of the desired state and describe the overall purpose of participating in an educational activity. Via et al. (2020, p. 4) note a number of features that must be considered when developing measurable learning outcomes:

- be specific and well-defined;
- be realistic;
- rely on active verbs;
- focus on learning products, not the learning process (6);
- be simple (7);
- be appropriate in number; and
- support assessments that generate actionable evidence.

To summarise: Learning outcomes should be based on competences that learners gain or improve, and should be formulated from the learner&#39;s perspective. They describe a specific action (either practical or cognitive) on a specific level (knowing what vs. knowing how). In other words, they describe what learners can do after having attended the unit, course or module. When writing a FAIR module description or workshop announcement, it may make sense to include how learning will be achieved (this part is more about the content), and why (this part is more about the incentives).

A helpful tool when formulating learning outcomes are taxonomies like the taxonomy of educational objectives by Benjamin Bloom (known as Bloom&#39;s taxonomy or BT) which defines cognitive levels of learning outcomes (Bloom et al. 1956), along with its revised version by Andersen and Krathwohl (Andersen and Krathwohl 2001) which provides suggestions for using actionable verbs to describe learning outcomes. A common practice is to define learning outcomes on different levels and with different granularity, e.g. for a whole course, a specific session, part of a session, macro and micro-goals. As a general rule, one session might have around 3 to 5 individual learning outcomes (this can be discussed and adapted to the given context, but it is important not to aim for more than can be achieved in the time available).

On a more generic level, the following learning outcomes could, for instance, be formulated using the verbs of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy to make learning outcomes actionable:

- Students can recognise and define the FAIR principles.
- Students can explain and interpret the FAIR principles.
- Students can apply the FAIR principles.
- Students can analyse and critically discuss the FAIR principles.
- Students can evaluate commonly used data repositories in terms of their compliance with the FAIR principles so they can use them in their field of research.

Furthermore, learning outcomes may be formulated on a more granular level, e.g.:

- for each of the FAIR elements;
- how these FAIR elements relate to the different stages of the data or research lifecycle; and
- for different learning levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

**(6)** This means to focus on what the learner will be able to do after the instruction (as opposed to what will be done during the instruction).

**(7)** This means not combining several pieces of knowledge, skills, or abilities in one learning outcome.
