### Step 4: Identify or develop assessments to ensure the learning is progressing towards learning outcomes

Developing appropriate assessments for teaching and training strategies, e.g. a workshop or an online course, is an important step for any successful and sustainable training programme. It will not only help to improve learners&#39; experiences but will also aid instructors in improving and updating content (Via et al. 2020). As illustrated in table 7 below, different assessments can be conducted at different levels and serve different purposes.

_Table 7: Approaches to assess progress towards learning outcomes_

| Assessment goals | Participants | Stakeholders | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - To identify learning progress of learners. <br>- To evaluate whether learners can apply their FAIR knowledge readily in a hands-on situation. | Learners | Learners &amp; Trainers | Ask learners to draft a DMP for their projects. This could be for an ongoing project or an example project. <br>Work with learners on the DMP to identify immediate knowledge gaps and provide relevant feedback and resources to learners via the drafted DMP. <br>Instructors may use resources such as DMP evaluation guidelines to facilitate the evaluation of the learners&#39; DMPs, e.g. Tuuli Working Group (2021), Donaldson et al. (2017). |
| - To collect information from learners on what they like or dislike about the content and format of delivery. <br>- The ultimate goal is to improve educational experiences for future learners. | Learners | Trainers | Teaching and training evaluation surveys are often used in this context. <br>Teaching and training programme developers might want to consult their institution&#39;s teaching and learning services (or equivalent) when preparing suitable evaluation survey questions. <br>Shorter training usually requires shorter evaluation surveys or a simple 3-2-1 assessment at the end of the training to ask learners to identify 3 things they have learned, 2 things they want to know, and 1 question they want to ask (Via et al. 2020). Samples of course evaluation questions for a full course or a comprehensive learning programme (consultation with your local teaching and learning services is recommended): <br>1.

|- Primarily for administrative purposes. <br>- To perform programme evaluation at the institutional level. <br>- To budget and plan for resources. | Trainers | Trainers and Institutions | Sample key performance indicators (KPIs): <br>- Enrolment rates and completion rates of a specific programme <br>- Learner satisfaction survey <br>- Working hours used |
