# How to contribute to the Handbook

In terms of content, this handbook should be regarded as a “frozen publication” for the time being, i.e. we will not update the content. We approached community initiatives regarding their potential involvement in future revisions, but these discussions are still ongoing.
Minor amendments (e.g. of typos, broken links) will be amended, so please let us know if you spot any.
