# 5. FAIR lesson plans

![](../Images/5_FAIR_curriculum_and_lesson_plans.PNG)

While [chapter 4](../4TeachingAndTrainingDesigns/1Introduction.md) introduced an approach to developing FAIR courses and elaborated on a number of relevant considerations in this respect, this chapter provides examples of lesson plans for a number of topics related to RDM and the FAIR principles. The following list of lesson plans is not exhaustive and can be updated.

List of lesson plans on RDM- and FAIR-related topics:

1. [FAIR in a nutshell](1LessonPlan.md)
2. [Data management plans (DMP)](2LessonPlan.md)
3. [Documentation](3LessonPlan.md)
4. [Data creation](4LessonPlan.md)
5. [File formats](5LessonPlan.md)
6. [Metadata](6LessonPlan.md)
7. [Data standardisation and ontologies](7LessonPlan.md)
8. [Persistent identifiers (PIDs)](8LessonPlan.md)
9. [Licences, copyright and intellectual property rights (IPR) issues](9LessonPlan.md)
10. [Finding and reusing data](10LessonPlan.md)
11. [Repositories](11LessonPlan.md)
12. [Dealing with confidential, personal, sensitive &amp; private data and ethical aspects](12LessonPlan.md)
13. [Data access](13LessonPlan.md)
14. [FAIR software/citable code](14LessonPlan.md)
15. [Research data management – overview and best practices](15LessonPlan.md)
16. [Data management and governance in industry and research](16LessonPlan.md)
 
All lesson plans follow the [same format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YO6U4Rq5s-g6dnpTVu6BD42jwt2-UqYiNFqZmzGKc2c/edit#heading=h.fzyhfqsl05zv) (11) which includes the FAIR elements concerned, the learning outcomes, a summary of tasks/actions, material/equipment needed, references and take-home tasks. More details on the implementation of FAIR aspects, i.e. the practical application of the content taught through the lesson plans, are provided in [chapter 6](../6ImplementingFAIR/1Introduction.md).
