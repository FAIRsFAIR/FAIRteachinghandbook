## Lesson plan 1: FAIR in a nutshell

**FAIR elements:**

**Findable**

The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the [FAIRification process](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/).

[**F1.** (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fair-data-principles-explained/f1-meta-data-assigned-globally-unique-persistent-identifiers/)

[**F2.** Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fair-data-principles-explained/f2-data-described-rich-metadata/)

[**F3.** Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f3-metadata-clearly-explicitly-include-identifier-data-describe/)

[**F4.** (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/f4-metadata-registered-indexed-searchable-resource/)

**Accessible**

Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

[**A1.** (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/542-2/)

[**A1.1.** The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-1-protocol-open-free-universally-implementable/)

[**A1.2.** The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a1-2-protocol-allows-authentication-authorisation-required/)

[**A2.** Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/a2-metadata-accessible-even-data-no-longer-available/)

**Interoperable**

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.

[**I1.** (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i1-metadata-use-formal-accessible-shared-broadly-applicable-language-knowledge-representation/)

[**I2.** (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i2-metadata-use-vocabularies-follow-fair-principles/)

[**I3.** (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-metadata/)

**Reusable**

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

[**R1.** (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-metadata-richly-described-plurality-accurate-relevant-attributes/)

[**R1.1.** (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-1-metadata-released-clear-accessible-data-usage-license/)

[**R1.2.** (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-2-metadata-associated-detailed-provenance/)

[**R1.3.** (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-3-metadata-meet-domain-relevant-community-standards/)

**Primary audience(s):** Bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s, PhD degree students

**Learning outcomes:**

- Can paraphrase the FAIR principles
- Can explain why the FAIR principles were developed
- Can recognise the relationship between FAIR, RDM and Open
- Can plan for FAIR research outputs
- Can write and develop a research data management plan
- Can apply the principles to their own work
- Can evaluate the FAIRness of their own work or the work of others

**Summary of tasks/actions:**

1. Introduction to the FAIR principles
   1. What is FORCE11 and where did the need to define the FAIR principles come from?
   2. What do the FAIR principles stand for [Wilkinson et al. 2016]?
      1. Findable
      2. Accessible
      3. Interoperable
      4. Reusable
2. Explain the difference and overlap between FAIR, Open Data and research data management
   1. Define Open Data
   2. Define research data management
   3. Show the relationship between FAIR, Open Data and RDM [Higman et al. 2019]
      1. Intersections between the terms
      2. Distinctions between the terms
3. How to make data FAIR? [The Top 10 FAIR data and software things; Knight 2015; PARTHENOS 2019]
   1. F is for making data findable
         - Look for existing data in repositories (see [lesson plan 10] (10LessonPlan.md))
         - Upload to and share your data via a repository (see [lesson plan 11](11LessonPlan.md))
         - Describe your data with as much detail as possible (see [lesson plan 6](6LessonPlan.md))
         - Apply a persistent identifier(see [lesson plan 8](8LessonPlan.md))

   2. A is for making data accessible
         - Consider what can and will be shared under which conditions (see [lesson plan 13](13LessonPlan.md)).
         - Obtain participant consent and perform risk management(see [lesson plan 12](12LessonPlan.md))

   3. I is for making data interoperable
       - Use open, standardised and common formats(see [lesson plan 5](5LessonPlan.md)
       - Consistent vocabulary
       - Apply common metadata standards(see [lesson plan 6](6LessonPlan.md)
       - Linked data

   4. R is for making data reusable
       - Consider permitted use
       - Apply appropriate license(see [lesson plan 9](9LessonPlan.md))
       - Add sufficient documentation and provenance information (see [lesson plan 3](3LessonPlan.md))
       - When using data of others, give credit by data citation (see [lesson plan 10](10LessonPlan.md))
