## Lesson plan 9: Licences, copyright and intellectual property rights (IPR) issues

**FAIR elements:**

**Reusable**

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

[**R1.** (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-metadata-richly-described-plurality-accurate-relevant-attributes/)

[**R1.1.** (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-1-metadata-released-clear-accessible-data-usage-license/)

[**R1.2.** (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-2-metadata-associated-detailed-provenance/)

[**R1.3.** (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-3-metadata-meet-domain-relevant-community-standards/)

**Primary audience(s)**: Bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s, PhD degree students

**Learning outcomes**:

- Understand what licences are, their purpose and relation with the FAIR principle
- Know how the data can be reused and shared with others
- Be able to identify the owner of the data for a project which may or may not have many partners
- Know what copyright and intellectual property rights are
- Be aware that different copyright rules exist in different countries (and that there are countries without copyright law)
- Know the different types of rights (economic and moral)
- Know the different types of licences and understand what actions can be performed with them, e.g. [CC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/), [ACA](https://www.kielipankki.fi/support/clarin-eula/), [OGL](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/), [LGPL](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/5-types-of-software-licenses-you-need-to-understand/)
- Know the meaning of non-commercial and commercial licences, e.g. CC BY-NC
- Know the different types of restrictions
- Know tools and guides to choose the correct licence
- Apply the acquired knowledge in practice, e.g. quiz, exercises

**Summary of tasks/actions:**

1. Introduction to licences and (re)use issues;
   1. FAIR focus on reusability, namely on [R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license point](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/r1-1-metadata-released-clear-accessible-data-usage-license/) of the FAIR principles. Licences, copyright and IPR issues help to clarify the FAIR reusable principle. They help identify legal, ethical and usage rights, understand who owns the copyright and IPR. Moreover, these issues help to prepare your data for professional reuse with or without restrictions, with an appropriate licence, while protecting you as licence holder and avoiding unpleasant situations surrounding reuse of data.
   2. What licences are, their purpose and importance

**Take-home tasks**

1. Looking at your own research project (master&#39;s thesis, PhD thesis, etc.), work through the information provided and identify what permissions you will need, and also what licences or copyright you would like to publish your work under.
2. Analyse different content with different licences, e.g. Flickr, YouTube, Wikimedia Commons, Vimeo, Wikipedia and the Internet Archive, Google.
3. See and analyse examples of the CC0 licence ([https://creativecommons.org/2017/02/07/met-announcement/](https://creativecommons.org/2017/02/07/met-announcement/)). Identify the specificity of this licence.
4. Find some examples of the real cases related to the licence, copyright and IPR issues, e.g. the case between Coca-Cola and Yotvata: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyhjM2BDQU&amp;ab\_channel=EliLevineGoldberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nyhjM2BDQU&amp;ab_channel=EliLevineGoldberg).
