**Summary of tasks/actions:**

1. Introduction to data management plan (DMP)
   1. DMP with reference to FAIRness
      <br>A good data management plan covers all _**FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)**_(17).
      <br>A DMP helps to make the data _**Findable (F principle)**_ because it includes all information about where data is stored and preserved, during and after the project. Moreover, a DMP also contains information about persistent identifiers, e.g. DOI, along with a description of the data and metadata standards used.
      <br>A DMP helps to make the data _**Accessible (A principle)**_ because it also includes information about how data can be accessed, what is required to access the data (authentication or authorisation) and by what (standardised and universal) communications protocol, e.g. HTTP, HTTPS.
      <br>A DMP helps to make the data _**Interoperable (I principle)**_, indicating which metadata standards, vocabularies, methodologies, and tools were used to facilitate interoperability. Moreover, a machine-actionable DMP also helps to address the ability of different systems and services to exchange both metadata and data produced during the project.
      <br>A DMP helps to make the data _**Reusable (R principle)**_ because it allows data to be described with more detail and accuracy, making it easier for others to understand. Moreover, during DMP creation, it is necessary to indicate the information that is needed to prepare the data for sharing and reuse with appropriate licences and rules, namely, how the data can be reused and for whom the data may be valuable.

   3. When is a DMP needed, at what stage of the project?

      1. What does data quality mean in research data management?
      2. Quality assurance guidelines (data description, metadata standards, documentation, data checking, etc.)
      3. Ensure quality control (curation processes, data entry programs, use of standardised data formats, etc.)

         2. taking duplicate samples or measurements
         3. standardised data capture, data entry or recording methods
         4. data entry validation techniques
         5. methods of transcription
